# Credit_Risk_Analysis
 
## Overview

For this project we applied machine learning techniques to predict credit risk. The goal being to provide a quicker and more reliable loan process. I have built several machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk. Using different techniques I'll be able to give a review on what could be the most affective.


## Results
### Logistic Regression
 - Random Oversampling: accuracy score of 62%.
 - SMOTE: accuracy score of 65%
 - Undersampling: accuracy score of 53%
 - Combination Sampling: accuracy score of 65%
 - Random Forest: accuracy score of 78%
 - Easy Ensemble: accuarcy score of 95%


## Recommendation
My recommmendation is to use Easy Esnemble for the algorithm to predict credit risk.
